This syllabus is specific to Gregory Ditzler's Jr/Sr clinic projects. Note that this syllabus is in *addition* to the [official syllabus](http://users.rowan.edu/~bakrania/PersonalPage/Smitesh_Bakrania,_Ph.D._files/syllabus.pdf) and [official grading scheme](http://users.rowan.edu/~bakrania/PersonalPage/Smitesh_Bakrania,_Ph.D._files/guidelines.pdf). 

**Instructor Details** <br>
Gregory Ditzler ([email](mailto:gregory.ditzler@gmail.com)) ([web](http://gregoryditzler.com)) <br>
Office Hours: By appointment only

**Expected Work Outcomes** <br>
Students are expected to spend - on average - 3 to 5 hours working in their clinic projects outside of the classroom. 

**Keeping a Research Log** <br>
There are several great practices that all good engineers, researchers, and managers do everyday to be efficient and productive. Keeping a daily log is certainly one of those practices. It is unlikely that you are going to remember everything you have done for your project, the problems that you encountered, and the solutions you developed to solve those problems. Hence, maintaining a log of your activities can help you keep track of and organize your thoughts and progress. The purpose of the log is to help you manage your time more efficiently and to help you stay on track. Remember: *projects fall behind one day at a time*. 

**Tentative Deadlines**

| Date | Deliverable |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| October | Literature Review |
| October/November | Midterm Project Presentations |
| December 18, 2014 | Final Report Due |
| December 18, 2014 |  Research Log Due |


* **Literature Review** - Each student is required to write a literature review of their project. The course instructor will provide you with a few pieces of literature; however, you are expected to read other papers than the ones that were provided to you. 	
* **Midterm Project Presentations** - Each group is required to prepare an approximately 20 minute presentation for their peers. The presentation should highlight the project goals and any current results. All team members are expected to contribute equally. 
* **Final Report (Seniors only)** - Each group is *required* to submit a final report. All reports should include: (i) an abstract, (ii) introduction, (iii) related work, (iv) methods, (v) results and (vi) a conclusions section. The report should be in double column IEEE format and a **minimum** of 4 complete pages (not including references). A portion of the letter grade will be doc'd for each page that is missing (e.g., if the report is four pages, perfect and all goals have been achieved then the maximum grade the project can receive is an A-. Two pages short all goals met would have a maximum grade of B+. Etc.). 
* **Research Log** - You are required to keep and submit a research log, which contains dates and accounts on what has been worked on during that time. A weekly report will be discussed in each class meeting; however, a log of all work should be recorded regardless of whether there was a meeting with the instructor. Each entry should - at a minimum -  contain the work performed on any particular day. I use [Evernote](http://evernote.com) to keep a research log and [ToDoist](http://todoist.com) for daily tasks.
